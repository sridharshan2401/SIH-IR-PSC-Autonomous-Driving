function scn = scenarioUrbanIntersection(res)
%SCENARIOURBANINTERSECTION SIH scenario B: busy unsignalized intersection.
%
%   COMPONENT STATUS: SIMPLIFIED SIMULATION
%   (NOT a RoadRunner scene. The SIH problem statement requires a detailed
%   RoadRunner urban-intersection scene; this is the MATLAB stand-in.
%   See roadrunner/ROADRUNNER_PLAN.md.)
%
%   scn = SCENARIOURBANINTERSECTION(res) builds a four-way junction with no
%   traffic signal and no marked right of way.
%
%   WHAT THIS SCENARIO IS DESIGNED TO TEST
%   --------------------------------------
%   Prediction under crossing traffic. Nothing here can be solved by
%   following the road: the hazards approach from the side, and the only way
%   to handle them well is to predict where they will be when the ego
%   arrives, rather than where they are now.
%
%   Specific challenges built in:
%     - Cross traffic from BOTH directions, timed to arrive at the junction
%       at roughly the same moment as the ego.
%     - No signal and no priority, so nobody yields. The scripted actors
%       will not stop for the ego under any circumstances.
%     - An auto-rickshaw merging informally from a side road without
%       signalling.
%     - A pedestrian crossing away from any marked crossing point.
%     - Building corners restrict visibility into the junction, so cross
%       traffic is occluded until relatively late -- this is what makes the
%       occlusion model in simulateDetections matter.
%
%   Expected discriminator: the baseline planner treats obstacles as static,
%   so a car that will be in the junction in 1.5 seconds is invisible to it
%   until it is already there. IR-PSC's predicted-occupancy risk sees the
%   conflict developing and can slow or shift early.
%
%   Inputs:
%       res - grid resolution in metres per cell
%
%   Outputs:
%       scn - scenario struct (see buildScenario for the field list)
%
%   Requires: base MATLAB only.
