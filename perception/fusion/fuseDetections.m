function fused = fuseDetections(detSets, cfg)
%FUSEDETECTIONS Combine camera, LiDAR and radar detections into one list.
%
%   COMPONENT STATUS: SIMPLIFIED (real algorithm, simplified association)
%
%   fused = FUSEDETECTIONS(detSets, cfg) merges detections from several
%   sensors that refer to the same physical object, producing one estimate
%   per object with better accuracy than any single sensor.
%
%   Why fuse at all
%   ---------------
%   The three sensors fail in different ways, and that is the point:
%     - the camera knows WHAT it is but is poor at HOW FAR,
%     - the LiDAR knows exactly where it is but not what it is,
%     - the radar knows how fast it is closing but only roughly where.
%   Fusing takes the class from the camera, the position from the LiDAR and
%   the velocity from the radar, which is strictly better than any one of
%   them.
%
%   Method
%   ------
%   Detections are grouped greedily by proximity, using a gate scaled by the
%   combined measurement uncertainty. Within a group, positions are combined
%   by INVERSE-COVARIANCE WEIGHTING:
%
%       P_fused = inv( sum_k inv(P_k) )
%       x_fused = P_fused * sum_k ( inv(P_k) * x_k )
%
%   This is the standard optimal linear combination for independent Gaussian
%   measurements. Practically, it means the LiDAR dominates the position
%   estimate because its covariance is smallest -- exactly the desired
%   behaviour, achieved without any hand-tuned per-sensor weights.
%
%   SIMPLIFICATION, stated honestly: association is greedy nearest-neighbour
%   rather than a global assignment, and the sensors' errors are assumed
%   independent. Both are reasonable at these object counts, and both are
%   things a production system would improve. With Sensor Fusion and
%   Tracking Toolbox available, trackerGNN or trackerJPDA would replace this
%   behind the same interface.
%
%   Inputs:
%       detSets - 1xS cell array, each cell a detection struct array from
%                 simulateDetections()
%       cfg     - config struct from irpscConfig()
%
%   Outputs:
%       fused - 1xF struct array with fields:
%               .pos        1x2 fused position
%               .vel        1x2 fused velocity, [NaN NaN] if unmeasured
%               .class      char, best available class
%               .confidence 0..1, raised when sensors agree
%               .posCov     2x2 fused covariance
%               .sensors    cellstr of contributing sensor names
%               .nSensors   how many sensors contributed
%               .truthId    true id if unambiguous, else NaN (diagnostics
%                           only -- never used by the planner)

% --- Flatten ------------------------------------------------------------
% NOTE: named allDets, not all. A variable named `all` would shadow the

% all(...) here would silently become an indexing operation on the struct
% array instead of a logical reduction.
