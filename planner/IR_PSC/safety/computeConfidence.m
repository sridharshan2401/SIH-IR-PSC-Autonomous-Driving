%   COMPONENT STATUS: REAL
%
%   [conf, breakdown] = COMPUTECONFIDENCE(corridor, preds, obstacles, cfg)
%   returns a single scalar in [0,1] summarising how well-founded the
%   current planning problem is.
%
%   IR-PSC steps 11 and 12: confidence-aware planning, and reduced autonomy
%   when confidence is insufficient.
%
%   This is the piece that turns "we know we might be wrong" into behaviour.
%   Rather than planning at full speed on bad data and hoping, the system
%   measures the quality of its own inputs and hands that number to the
%   decision logic, which slows down or stops.
%
%   Four contributions, each genuinely measurable from data the system
%   already has:
%
%     corridorScore   (weight 0.35) - corridor.quality: how much of the
%                     requested lookahead was achieved, how much of it is
%                     wide enough, and how many boundary rays actually found
%                     an edge rather than running to maximum range.
%
%     perceptionScore (weight 0.25) - mean detection/track confidence of the
%                     road users currently being tracked.
%
%     trackScore      (weight 0.20) - track maturity. A scene full of tracks
%                     one frame old is a scene we do not yet understand.
%
%     predictScore    (weight 0.20) - inverse of mean predicted uncertainty
%                     at the end of the horizon, normalised by
%                     cfg.prediction.maxSigma. Vague predictions lower
%                     confidence.
%
%   HONESTY NOTE: this is a designed heuristic, not a calibrated probability.
%   It has not been validated against outcomes, and a confidence of 0.8 does
%   NOT mean "80% chance of being right". It is an internal, monotonic
%   quality signal: higher means better-founded. Calibrating it against
%   recorded outcomes is future work.
%
%   Inputs:
%       corridor  - corridor struct from extractCorridor()
%       preds     - prediction struct array from predictObstacles()
%       obstacles - obstacle struct array (current tracks)
%       cfg       - config struct from irpscConfig()
%
%   Outputs:
%       conf      - scalar in [0,1]
%       breakdown - struct with the four component scores and their weights,
%                   so a demo can show WHY confidence dropped
%
%   If cfg.ablation.useConfidenceAware is false, conf is forced to 1.0.
%   That is the "no confidence-aware behaviour" ablation.
%
%   Example:
%       [c, b] = computeConfidence(corr, preds, obs, cfg);
