function [vCeil, info] = leadVehicleCeiling(corridor, dPath, preds, obstacles, ego, cfg, vp)
%LEADVEHICLECEILING Speed ceiling that keeps a safe gap to road users in the path.
%
%   COMPONENT STATUS: REAL (constant-deceleration gap keeping)
%
%   [vCeil, info] = LEADVEHICLECEILING(corridor, dPath, preds, obstacles, ego, cfg, vp)
%   returns a per-station speed ceiling that makes the vehicle FOLLOW a
%   slower road user it cannot pass, or come to a controlled stop behind a
%   road user standing in its path, instead of driving into it.
%
%   Why this was added (Phase 2)
%   ----------------------------
%   The original pipeline had exactly two responses to a slower vehicle
%   ahead: bend around it, or perform an emergency stop. On a narrow Indian
%   road, or behind a truck on a highway with oncoming traffic, the correct
%   behaviour is usually neither -- it is to slow down and follow until an
%   overtaking gap opens. That is ordinary driving, and without it the
%   demonstration either collided or emergency-stopped behind every truck.
%
%   Which road users count
%   ----------------------
%   A road user constrains speed if, at the time the ego would reach its
%   current along-road position (clamped to the prediction horizon), its
%   PREDICTED position lies laterally within the planned path's swept
%   width plus cfg.safety.lateralClearance. A pedestrian who will have
%   finished crossing by then does not count (the time-aware risk grid and
%   clearance check handle that case); a slow bicycle that will still be in
%   the path does.
%
%   The gap
%   -------
%   Desired gap to the rear of the road user =
%       cfg.safety.longitudinalGap + cfg.safety.timeGap * vLead
%   where vLead is the road user's speed along the road (0 if it is
%   stationary or oncoming). Before the gap point the ceiling is
%       sqrt(vLead^2 + 2 * cfg.safety.leadDecel * distanceToGapPoint)
%   and beyond it the ceiling tapers from vLead to 0 across one gap length.
%
%   Inputs:
%       corridor  - (usable) corridor struct
%       dPath     - Nx1 planned lateral offset at each station
%       preds     - prediction struct array, same order as obstacles
%       obstacles - obstacle struct array
%       ego       - ego state
%       cfg, vp   - config and vehicle params
%
%   Outputs:
%       vCeil - Nx1 speed ceiling (m/s), Inf where unconstrained
%       info - struct: .active (logical), .id (track id of the binding road
%              user, NaN), .class, .gap (current bumper gap, m), .leadSpeed
%
%   Requires: base MATLAB only.
