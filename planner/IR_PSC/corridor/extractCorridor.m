function corridor = extractCorridor(grid, ego, cfg, priorCenter)
%EXTRACTCORRIDOR Build the drivable safety corridor from free space.
%
%   COMPONENT STATUS: REAL
%
%   corridor = EXTRACTCORRIDOR(grid, ego, cfg, priorCenter) estimates the
%   left and right drivable boundaries ahead of the vehicle and the
%   continuous centreline between them.
%
%   This function is the centre of the IR-PSC contribution. It implements
%   the principle that gives the project its name:
%
%       "Lane is an optional cue; drivable space is the primary
%        planning constraint."
%
%   Nothing here looks for a painted line. Boundaries are found by casting
%   rays perpendicular to a seed path until free space ends. On a village
%   road with no markings at all, this still produces a usable corridor.
%
%   IR-PSC steps 1 and 2: estimate drivable space, identify boundaries.
%
%   Algorithm
%   ---------
%     1. SEEDCENTERLINE marches through free space to guess the road course.
%     2. Resample the seed to uniform stations.
%     3. At each station cast one ray left and one ray right, perpendicular
%        to the seed heading, until free space ends.
%     4. Erode both boundaries inward by cfg.corridor.boundaryErode so the
%        corridor never touches the exact edge of measured free space.
%     5. Recompute the centreline as the midpoint of the eroded boundaries,
%        then smooth it. This corrects the seed's greedy lateral bias.
%     6. Blend with the previous frame's centreline for temporal stability,
%        ALIGNED IN SPACE (see below).
%     7. Classify every station as clear, NARROW or BLOCKED and truncate
%        the usable corridor at the first blocked station.
%
%   Why step 5 matters: the seed hugs whichever side had more space. Taking
%   the midpoint of the measured boundaries recentres the corridor, which is
%   what makes the preferred trajectory road-following rather than
%   free-space-hugging.
%
%   Temporal blending (Phase 2 fix)
%   -------------------------------
%   The vehicle moves between planning cycles, so station i of the previous
%   centreline is NOT the same place as station i of the new one. The old
%   code blended them index by index, dragging the corridor backwards and
%   sideways on bends. Each new station is now blended towards the closest
%   point of the previous centreline (a purely lateral correction), and only
%   where the previous centreline actually covers that stretch of road.
%
%   Narrow and blocked stations (Phase 2 fix)
%   -----------------------------------------
%   Previously one station narrower than cfg.corridor.minWidth ANYWHERE in
%   the lookahead made the whole corridor invalid, which triggered an
%   emergency stop tens of metres before a pinch point. Now:
%     - NARROW  : eroded width < cfg.corridor.minWidth. Passable slowly with
%                 reduced side margins (see corridorBounds, irpscPlanner).
%     - BLOCKED : measured free width < ego width + 2 * the hard minimum
%                 clearance cfg.safety.minLateralClearance. The body cannot
%                 fit. The corridor is truncated here (usableLength) and the
%                 planner plans a controlled stop before it.
%   The safety margins themselves are unchanged.
%
%   Inputs:
%       grid        - occupancy grid struct from makeOccupancyGrid()
%       ego         - ego state struct from makeEgoState()
%       cfg         - config struct from irpscConfig()
%       priorCenter - (optional) Mx2 centreline from the previous planning
%                     cycle, used for temporal smoothing. Pass [] on the
%                     first cycle.

%           .rightDist   Nx1 signed distance from centreline to right boundary
%           .leftObserved  Nx1 logical, false where the ray found no edge
%           .rightObserved Nx1 logical, same for the right side
%           .narrow      Nx1 logical, passable only slowly
%           .blocked     Nx1 logical, the vehicle body does not fit
%           .usableLength scalar, arc length to the first blocked station
%           .blockedIdx  index of the first blocked station ([] if none)
%           .minWidth    scalar, narrowest point (m)
%           .valid       logical, true if a usable corridor exists
%           .quality     0..1 corridor confidence (see below)
%           .length      scalar, corridor length in m
%           .stalled     logical, from the seed march
%
%   Quality score
%   -------------
%   quality combines three things that are all genuinely measurable here:
%     - how much of the requested lookahead distance was achieved,
%     - what fraction of stations are at least minWidth wide,
%     - what fraction of boundary rays actually found an edge.
%   A ray that runs to maxRayLength without hitting anything means the road
%   edge was NOT observed (open field, missing return, sensor gap). Treating
%   that as a confident boundary would be dishonest, so it lowers quality
%   and, through it, the planner's confidence. This is what feeds
%   confidence-aware behaviour downstream.
%
%   Example:
%       corridor = extractCorridor(grid, ego, irpscConfig('village'), []);
