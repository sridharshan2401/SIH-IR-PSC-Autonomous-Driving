function hit = potholeWheelOverlap(corridor, D, potholes, cfg, vp)
%POTHOLEWHEELOVERLAP Which (station, offset) choices put a tyre into a pothole.
%
%   COMPONENT STATUS: SIMPLIFIED (planar wheel-track geometry)
%
%   hit = POTHOLEWHEELOVERLAP(corridor, D, potholes, cfg, vp) returns an
%   NxKxP logical array. hit(i,j,p) is true when a vehicle whose rear axle
%   passes corridor station i at lateral offset D(i,j) would run a tyre
%   (rear OR front axle, left OR right wheel) through pothole p.
%
%   Why wheel tracks and not the body footprint
%   -------------------------------------------
%   A pothole is a road-surface hazard, not an obstacle: the body passes
%   over it harmlessly, only the tyres drop in. A small pothole that fits
%   between the two wheel tracks can be STRADDLED at full speed, which is
%   exactly what an experienced Indian driver does. Treating potholes as
%   occupied cells would forbid that and would wrongly block narrow roads.
%
%   Geometry: each pothole is an ellipse (length along its yaw, width
%   across) projected into the corridor frame as an along/across extent.
%   Each wheel is a strip of width cfg.pothole.tyreWidth centred at lateral
%   offset d +/- wheelTrack/2. The rear wheels are at the station, the front
%   wheels one wheelbase further along.
%
%   Inputs:
%       corridor - corridor struct from extractCorridor()
%       D        - NxK lateral offsets (m), or Nx1 for a single path
%       potholes - struct array with fields .pos .length .width .yaw
%                  (pothole tracks from potholeTracker, or ground truth)
%       cfg      - config struct from irpscConfig()
%       vp       - vehicle params struct from vehicleParams()
%
%   Outputs:
%       hit - NxKxP logical
%
%   Requires: base MATLAB only.
