function [rmse, details] = metricPredictionError(log, cfg)
%METRICPREDICTIONERROR Accuracy of short-term road-user prediction.
%
%   COMPONENT STATUS: REAL
%
%   [rmse, details] = METRICPREDICTIONERROR(log, cfg) compares what the
%   predictor said each road user would do against what the scenario ground
%   truth shows they actually did.
%
%   Method
%   ------
%   For each logged step, each prediction is looked up at a fixed horizon
%   ahead, and compared with the true position of that same road user at
%   that later time. Errors are accumulated across every road user and every
%   step, and reported as RMS displacement error in metres.
%
%   Errors are reported per horizon (1 s, 2 s and the full horizon) because
%   a single averaged number hides the shape of the failure. Prediction
%   error always grows with horizon; what matters is HOW FAST. A predictor
%   that is excellent at 1 s and hopeless at 3 s is a different engineering
%   problem from one that is mediocre throughout.
%
%   Matching is by track id against ground-truth id. Road users that appear
%   or disappear mid-horizon are skipped rather than counted as large
%   errors, since that would measure track lifetime rather than prediction.
%
%   Inputs:
%       log - simulation log struct with fields .t, .preds, .obstacles
%             (.obstacles holds GROUND TRUTH, .preds holds predictions)
%       cfg - config struct from irpscConfig()
%
%   Outputs:
%       rmse    - RMS displacement error over all horizons (m), NaN if no
%                 comparable pair was found
%       details - struct with .rmseAt1s, .rmseAt2s, .rmseAtHorizon,
%                 .nSamples
%
%   Requires: base MATLAB only.
