## ⚠️ Read this before anything else

**No part of this project has ever been executed.** MATLAB, Simulink, Stateflow and RoadRunner were not installed on the machine where it was written. Every `.m` file was written against documented MATLAB semantics, but none has been parsed by MATLAB, let alone run.

**Expect errors on first run.** That is the unavoidable consequence of writing several thousand lines without an interpreter available, and it is stated here rather than left for a judge to discover.

There are also things this package deliberately does **not** contain, because they cannot be created honestly without the software:

| Not present | Why | How to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `.slx` Simulink model | Only Simulink can create one | `simulink/buildClosedLoopModel.m` |
| `.sfx` Stateflow chart | Only Stateflow can create one | `decision/stateflow/STATEFLOW_SPEC.md` |
| `.rrscene` RoadRunner scenes | RoadRunner is a visual 3D editor | `roadrunner/ROADRUNNER_PLAN.md` |
| `.prj` MATLAB Project | MATLAB generates and manages it | `scripts/createProject.m` |
| Any result, figure or metric | Would require an executed run | Run it yourself |

**The SIH requirement for at least two detailed RoadRunner scenes is currently NOT MET.** See [`roadrunner/ROADRUNNER_PLAN.md`](roadrunner/ROADRUNNER_PLAN.md).

## Quick start

```matlab
cd <this folder>
setupPaths                    % adds all source folders to the path
runAllTests('unit')           % expect failures; fix them; record the real numbers
demoScenario('village')       % watch it drive an unmarked village road
```

Then, once the tests pass:

```matlab
runAllExperiments(1:10)       % baseline comparison + ablation study
```

**The whole planner runs on base MATLAB.** No toolbox is required for any of the above. That was a deliberate design decision — see [Design decisions](#design-decisions-worth-knowing).

## What this system does

It plans a path for a vehicle on roads that have no usable lane markings, sharing space with cars, buses, trucks, auto-rickshaws, two-wheelers, bicycles, pedestrians, pushcarts and animals that do not follow lane discipline and may not follow the rules at all.

The pipeline, and where each stage lives:

```
scenario ground truth
    → camera + LiDAR + radar simulation        sensors/, perception/detection/
    → multi-sensor fusion                      perception/fusion/
    → multi-object tracking                    perception/tracking/
    → short-term prediction with uncertainty   prediction/
    → IR-PSC planner                           planner/IR_PSC/
    → decision logic (6 states, debounced)     decision/
    → controller                               vehicle/controller/
    → vehicle dynamics                         vehicle/dynamics/
    → back to the sensors (closed loop)
```

## The IR-PSC hierarchy

Thirteen steps, and the file that implements each:

| # | Step | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Estimate drivable space | `seedCenterline.m` |
| 2 | Identify road boundaries | `extractCorridor.m` |
| 3 | Track surrounding road users | `multiObjectTracker.m` |
| 4 | Predict short-term occupancy | `predictObstacles.m` |
| 5 | Represent uncertainty | `predictionUncertainty.m` |
| 6 | Estimate collision risk | `lateralRiskGrid.m`, `conflictRisk.m` |
| 7 | Continuous preferred trajectory | `extractCenterline.m` |
| 8 | Deform locally around hazards | `deformTrajectory.m` |
| 9 | Preserve boundary and obstacle margins | `corridorBounds.m`, `checkClearance.m` |
| 10 | Smooth spatially and temporally | `generateTrajectory.m`, `smoothPath.m` |
| 11 | Check vehicle feasibility | `checkFeasibility.m` |
| 12 | Confidence-aware behaviour | `computeConfidence.m` |
| 13 | Degrade or stop safely | `safeStopTrajectory.m`, `decisionLogic.m` |

## The five SIH scenarios

| Scenario | Command | What it is built to test |
|---|---|---|
| A. Unmarked village road | `demoScenario('village')` | The central claim: **no lane markings exist at all** |
| B. Unsignalized intersection | `demoScenario('urban')` | Prediction under occluded crossing traffic |
| C. Highway merge | `demoScenario('highway')` | Early decisions at speed; shallow-angle merge |
| D. Dense market | `demoScenario('market')` | Everything at once; confidence-aware slowdown |
| E. Sudden cattle crossing | `demoScenario('cattle')` | Emergency escalation and safe stop |

## Design decisions worth knowing

**The planner depends on base MATLAB only.** Not one line of the IR-PSC pipeline calls a toolbox function. This means the whole thing can be unit-tested and demonstrated **before** the RoadRunner licensing question is settled. If RoadRunner turns out to be unavailable, the planner still runs and still produces the baseline comparison.

**The planner's input is an occupancy grid, not a road network.** That is what lets it work identically on a RoadRunner scene, a `drivingScenario`, or a hand-built MATLAB scenario — and it is what makes "no lane markings required" true at the interface, not just in the algorithm.

**Simulink wraps the MATLAB functions; it does not reimplement them.** There is one implementation of the planner. A second one inside Simulink would silently drift out of step with the first.

**Every experiment is seeded.** Both planners face byte-identical noise, missed detections and false positives. Without that the comparison would measure luck.

**`computeMetrics` throws on an empty log.** By construction, you cannot get a metric out of this project without having run something.

## Honest limitations

- Nothing has been executed. No result exists.
- The sensor model is geometric. **No detector has been trained.** Auto-rickshaws, pushcarts and cattle are not classes any stock detector provides — see [`docs/PERCEPTION_NOTES.md`](docs/PERCEPTION_NOTES.md).
- The vehicle model is kinematic: no tyre slip, no suspension, no powertrain lag.
- Scenario actors are **scripted and do not react to the ego vehicle**. These scenarios cannot demonstrate negotiation or mutual yielding.
- The tracker uses greedy association and can swap tracks in dense crowds.
- Confidence is a designed heuristic, not a calibrated probability.
- Potholes are modelled as planning obstacles, never as ride disturbances.

## Claims not made

No safety certification. No guaranteed collision avoidance. No zero-accident claim. No real-world readiness. No real sensor performance. This is simulation research code.
