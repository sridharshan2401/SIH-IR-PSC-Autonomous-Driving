function occupied = isOccupiedAt(grid, pts)
%ISOCCUPIEDAT Query occupancy of the grid at world coordinates.
%
%   COMPONENT STATUS: REAL
%
%   occupied = ISOCCUPIEDAT(grid, pts) returns true for each query point
%   that falls in an occupied cell OR outside the grid.
%
%   Treating out-of-grid as occupied is deliberate: space we have no
%   information about is not space we are willing to drive into. This makes
%   the planner fail safe at the edge of sensor coverage instead of
%   confidently planning into the unknown.
%
%   Inputs:
%       grid - struct from makeOccupancyGrid()
%       pts  - Mx2 array of [x y] world points
%
%   Outputs:
%       occupied - Mx1 logical
%
%   Example:
%       occ = isOccupiedAt(g, [1.0 2.0; 3.0 4.0]);
%
%   Requires: base MATLAB only.
